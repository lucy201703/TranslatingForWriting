Op-Ed Piece: A Natural Way to Write
Traditional writing instruction tacitly assumes that writing is a normal human activity requiring no fundamental cognitive work. We begin by acknowledging the fact that writing is utterly alien to the human evolutionary endowment. There is, however, a species-wide, ancient behavior underlying writing. Cognitive scientists call it "joint attention," and we think it is the most sensible and practical place to begin learning to write.


评论：以一种天然的方式写作

传统的写作教学默认写作是一项普通的人类活动, 不需要基本的认知工作。我们首先承认, 写作与人类进化习得的禀赋是完全不同的。然而,写作背后有一种独特、古老的行为。认知科学家称其为 "联合注意"，我们认为这是开始学习写作的最明智和最实用的地方。

其他推荐语：

"Clear and Simple as the Truth is an island of elegance. This book won't tell you about working in publishing and doesn't mention the Internet. It goes back to the source - the reason many of us got into this field in the first place - a love of language, of thoughts perfectly expressed, concepts elegantly communicated. When the authors say that the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds is the epitome of classic writing, we believe them. We believe almost everything these authors say, because they say it so incredibly well." 
— Judy Cleary, The Editorial Eye


“《Clear and Simple As the Truth》是一座优雅的岛屿。这本书不会告诉你一本书的出版工作, 也不会提及互联网。它追踪溯源--我们起初喜欢写作的原因--一种对语言的爱, 对准确表达思想的爱，优雅传达概念的爱。当作者说, 《北美鸟类奥杜邦协会野外指南》是古典写作的代表， 我们相信他们。我们相信他们说的一切, 因为他们说得非常好。”——  朱蒂·柯里尔瑞，杂志Eye的编辑

"This marvelous little book avoids the inevitable arguments that arise from even the best How To and How Not To books. It does this by describing some fundamental questions that they identify as the elements of style and by illustrating the way that classic style can be defined by a particular set of answers to those questions. Stimulating, fresh, invigorating. I recommend it highly."
— Michael Gordon-Smith.

这本奇妙的小书避开了甚至是最好的关于如何写以及如何不写的一些书引发的不可避免的争论。它是这样做的，首先提出了一些基本的问题, 并把它们作为风格的基本要素, 然后通过这些问题的一特定系列的答案，阐释了古典风格的定义。新鲜有趣、神清气爽。我极力推荐。——— 迈克尔·戈登·史密斯

"Clear and Simple is not just an almost peerless manual of style. Like George Orwell's 'Politics and the English Language' and Herbert Read's English Prose Style, it uncovers the intricate relationship between literary expression, mental power, ideological bent, and personal character. It does this by close analysis of brilliantly chosen texts in several languages. Since it is itself an exhibit of classic style, it is a delight to read and reread." 
— Richard Stern, novelist and professor, The University of Chicago.

"简洁和清晰不仅是一种近乎无与伦比的风格手册。就像乔治奥·威尔的 "政治和英语"和赫伯特·瑞德的英语散文风格一样, 它揭示了文学表达、精神力量、意识形态倾向和个人品格之间错综复杂的关系。它通过仔细分析从数种语言中精选的不同文本来做到这一点。而且这本书自身呈现的就是古典风格, 一读再读，喜不自胜。
——Richard Stern, novelist and professor, The University of Chicago. 理查德·斯特恩，小说家和教授，芝加哥大学

**Confusion&Difficulties**

- Herbert Read's English Prose Style

"As Francis-Noël Thomas and Mark·Turner argue in this intriguing (for those of you who share my enthusiasms, I'll go so far as to call it thrilling) volume, learning to write is inevitably to learn styles of writing. This is a rigorous, extraordinarily captivating book, which, in its acute attention to the intellectual assumptions that shape prose style, has much to teach anyone caught in the web of words."
— James Mustich, Jr. in A Common Reader. Go to full review.

"正如弗朗西斯-Noël 托马斯和马克·特纳在这本有趣的书(对于那些分享我的热情的人, 我只会把它叫做兴奋) 中的争论, 学习写作不可避免地要学习写作风格。这是一本严谨、引人入胜的书, 它敏锐地关注着可塑造散文风格的智力假设，里面有很多知识可以教给陷在文字网中的人们。
